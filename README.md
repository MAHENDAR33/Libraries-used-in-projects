# Libraries-used-in-projects


Libraries used in projects:
1. nltk (Natural Language Toolkit)
•	Purpose: A suite of libraries and programs for natural language processing (NLP). It supports text processing tasks such as tokenization, classification, stemming, tagging, parsing, and semantic reasoning.
2. numpy
•	Purpose: A powerful library for numerical computing in Python. It provides support for arrays, matrices, and many mathematical functions to perform operations on these data structures.
3. torch (PyTorch)
•	Purpose: An open-source deep learning framework that provides tools for building neural networks, performing tensor operations, and automatic differentiation, commonly used for machine learning and AI applications.
4. fpdf
•	Purpose: A library for generating PDF documents in Python. It allows you to create PDFs programmatically, enabling the addition of text, images, and custom layouts.
5. PIL (Python Imaging Library) / Pillow
•	Purpose: Used for image processing tasks like opening, manipulating, and saving various image formats. It also supports many image operations like resizing, cropping, and filtering.
6. os
•	Purpose: Provides a way of interacting with the operating system, including file and directory manipulation, running system commands, and handling environment variables.
7. random
•	Purpose: Provides functions for generating random numbers, making random selections, and performing random operations, which can be useful for random sampling and simulation.
8. shutil
•	Purpose: Used for high-level file operations such as copying, moving, and removing files and directories.
9. google.colab
•	Purpose: A set of libraries specifically for working with Google Colab environments, enabling integration with Google Drive, file uploads, and other Google resources.
10. pandas
•	Purpose: A data manipulation and analysis library. It provides data structures like DataFrame and Series to efficiently handle large datasets and perform operations like filtering, grouping, merging, and pivoting data.
11. sklearn (scikit-learn)
•	Purpose: A machine learning library that includes a wide range of algorithms for classification, regression, clustering, and dimensionality reduction, along with tools for model evaluation and preprocessing.
12. pickle
•	Purpose: A Python library used for serializing (saving) and deserializing (loading) Python objects, enabling you to save machine learning models, data structures, and other objects for future use.
13. streamlit
•	Purpose: A framework for building interactive web applications with minimal code. It’s used to create data dashboards and deploy machine learning models as web apps with a simple interface.
14. selenium
•	Purpose: A web testing and automation framework that can interact with web browsers. It allows for automating actions like clicking buttons, filling out forms, and scraping data from websites.
15. requests
•	Purpose: A simple and easy-to-use library for making HTTP requests, including GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE methods. It simplifies web scraping, API calls, and other web-related tasks.
16. time
•	Purpose: Provides functions for working with time-related tasks like pausing execution for a certain period, formatting time, and measuring execution time.
17. cv2 (OpenCV)
•	Purpose: A computer vision library that provides tools for image and video processing tasks such as feature extraction, face detection, object tracking, and image transformation.
18. matplotlib
•	Purpose: A plotting library used for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. It’s commonly used to generate graphs, charts, and figures.
19. pywt (PyWavelets)
•	Purpose: A library for wavelet transforms, which are used for signal processing, data compression, and feature extraction from time-series and image data.
20. sklearn.svm (Support Vector Machines)
•	Purpose: Part of scikit-learn, it includes tools for building and training Support Vector Machines, which are powerful supervised learning models used for classification and regression tasks.
21. sklearn.preprocessing (StandardScaler, etc.)
•	Purpose: Provides tools for scaling and normalizing data to improve the performance of machine learning algorithms. StandardScaler, for example, standardizes features by removing the mean and scaling to unit variance.
22. sklearn.model_selection (train_test_split, GridSearchCV)
•	Purpose: Contains functions for splitting datasets into training and test sets and for hyperparameter tuning using methods like cross-validation and grid search.
23. sklearn.pipeline
•	Purpose: Helps in assembling several steps that can be cross-validated together into a single pipeline, making the process of building and deploying machine learning models more efficient.
24. joblib
•	Purpose: A library for efficient serialization of Python objects, particularly useful for saving and loading large machine learning models. It’s faster than pickle when dealing with large numpy arrays or objects.
25. google.oauth2 (Service Account Authentication)
•	Purpose: Provides tools for authenticating and authorizing Google Cloud resources using service account credentials.
26. googleapiclient.discovery
•	Purpose: Enables interaction with Google APIs like Google Drive, Sheets, Gmail, etc., by creating a service object for performing API operations.
27. smtplib
•	Purpose: A library for sending emails via the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP). It can be used for creating email applications that send messages from Python.
28. email.mime.multipart
•	Purpose: Used to create email messages with multiple parts, such as text and attachments, making it easier to send complex emails.
29. email.mime.text
•	Purpose: A module used to create text-based email content (plain text or HTML).
